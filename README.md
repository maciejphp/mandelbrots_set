Mandelbrot-set, yo, it's straight up dope,
In the realm of math where the boundaries scope.
Complex numbers dancing, in a wild spree,
Check the Mandelbrot set, that's where it be.

Fractal world, with its intricate design,
Zooming in, out, it's a crazy climb.
Iterations spiraling, ain't no stoppin',
Every twist and turn got your mind poppin'.

From the depths of chaos, it takes its stand,
A mathematical wonder, ain't that grand?
Colors bursting, shapes colliding,
In the Mandelbrot set, there's no denying.
